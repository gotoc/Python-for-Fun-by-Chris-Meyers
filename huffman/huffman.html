The computer I am using now has over 1 million times the memory of my first PC that I bought in 1983, and the new 80 gigabyte disk holds 4000 times the amount of data. The first computer also cost a lot more.</p><p>Ironically, space is still at a premium primarily because as the machines have gotten bigger and faster, so have the problems we want to solve.</p><p>In this study we'll look at an early algorithm developed by David Huffman in 1952 when he was a graduate student at MIT. The algorithm squeezes the &quot;fluff&quot; out of data but in a way that the original can be reproduced exactly. You see this done in programs like Winzip, stuffit, or for Unix folk, gzip. This is called &quot;lossless&quot; compression and is different from &quot;lossy&quot; compression used in audio and video files where the exact original cannot be reproduced.</p><p>For demonstration purposes we'll stick with character data and mostly just use a small subset of the alphabet. As usual, we'll use small amounts of Python code to make it all work.</p><p>Computers store text in several ways. The most common encoding is Ascii where each character is stored in an 8 bit byte. So, for example, the character 'e' is the bit sequence '001100101'. As any byte can take one of 256 distinct values (0 to 255) there is plenty of room for the Latin alphabet, the numbers zero to nine and lots of punctuation characters such as periods, commas, newline indicators and so on. Actually, if we stick to English text, we can get by the first 127 values. Other European languages require some more letters and use the upper range 128-255 as well. Still other languages, like Russian or Chinese, require more elaborate coding systems such as Unicode where multiple bytes are used per character.</p><p>The secret of compressing data lies in the fact that not all characters are equally common. For instance, in typical English text the letter 'e' is much more common than the letter 'z'. In fact there are roughly 70 'e's for every 'z'. If we could encode the letter 'e' with less than the usual 8 bits and in exchange let the letter 'z' be take more, we'd be money ahead.</p><p>This sort of thing is pretty common. Human languages have mostly evolved so that the most common words such as &quot;I&quot;, &quot;am&quot;, &quot;Yo&quot;, &quot;soy&quot;, &quot;ich&quot; and &quot;bin&quot; are nearly as short as possible. Uncommon words like &quot;ominous&quot;, &quot;peligroso&quot;, or &quot;Einkommensteurerkl&auml;rung&quot; come rarely enough to not make too much difference.</p><h2>Huffman Data Compression.<a name="auto0"></a></h2><p>We will look at several functions that bring together an example of Huffman data compression for text files. These functions do the following.</p><p>1. Examine text to be compressed to determine the relative frequencies of individual letters.</p><p>2. Assign a binary code to each letter using shorter codes for the more frequent letters. This is the heart of the Huffman algorithm.</p><p>3. Encode normal text into its compressed form. We'll see this just as a string of '0's and '1's. This will turn out to be quite easy.</p><p>4. Recover the original text from the compressed. This will demonstrate a nice use of recursive traversal of a binary tree, but will still remain fairly simple.</p><p>To view the complete computer program's source code  <a href="huffman.py.txt">Click Here</a>.</p><h2>Determining Relative Frequencies.<a name="auto1"></a></h2><p>Our function &quot;frequency&quot; takes a text string as input and returns a dictionary of the letters encountered with a count of how often they appear.</p><pre class="python">

If the letter is not already in the dictionary, the default value zero is returned, otherwise its existing count. In either case the count is incremented and the key/value pair is updated or newly added to the dictionary.</p><h2>Assigning codes to the Characters<a name="auto2"></a></h2><p>Our next function builds and sorts a list of tuples.

 &gt;&gt;&gt; tuples = huffman.sortFreq(freqs)
 &gt;&gt;&gt; print tuples
 [(1, 'b'), (1, 'd'), (1, 'g'), (2, 'c'), (2, 'f'), (3, 'a'), (5, 'e')] &gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre><p>The sort method for a list compares individual elements. In this case the elements are tuples of two values, a number and a character. The sort method will first compare the numbers and only if they are equal will it compare the character values. Notice that sorting the list has the effect of moving the least common letters to the front of the list. This will be very convenient.</p><p>Let's jump ahead just a bit. Here are the codes that will be assigned to each of the seven characters.</p><pre class="shell">
      a   '00'
      b   '1010'
      c   '011'
      d   '1011'
      e   '11'
      f   '100'
      g   '010'
</pre><p>Each character is assigned to a string of 0's and 1's. We're cheating a bit. It's easier to use strings in our program than the actual bits we would use in real life. But see the exercises at the end.</p><p>Notice that the two most common characters, &quot;a&quot; and &quot;e&quot; are represented by just two bits, whereas the two least common characters &quot;b&quot; and &quot;d&quot; each use four bits.</p><p>Perhaps not so easy to see is that there is no ambiguity in this encoding. Any string of zero's and one's will map to a unique string of the characters 'a' to 'g'. This is much more intuitive if we draw a tree for the code table.</p><p><img src="tree.jpg" /></p><p>If we start at the bottom and traverse up the tree through the branches we can arrive at any character in a series of left and right turns. If we add a &quot;zero&quot; for each left turn and a &quot;one&quot; for each right turn, the coding for the character at the end is produced. For example, a left-right-left takes us to the letter &quot;g&quot; which has &quot;010&quot; for its code.</p><p>Since a unique path leads to each letter we don't need anything to delimit one character from another. We will be able to just run their bits together.</p><p>So now let's back up and see how this tree is built from the frequency distribution. It is both clever and actually not too hard.</p><p>Remember we had the following list of tuples. The tuples are in order of the frequency of the letter each represents. We will turn this list into a tree.</p><pre class="python-interpreter">
 &gt;&gt;&gt; print tuples
 [(1, 'b'), (1, 'd'), (1, 'g'), (2, 'c'), (2, 'f'), (3, 'a'), (5, 'e')]   </pre><p>Unlike real trees, our tree will grow from the top to the bottom, from the leafs back to the root. (Whimsical fantasy should be in every programmers toolbox). We'll pull two elements from the front of the list and combine them into a new element. Remember these 2 elements will have the least frequencies. The new element will be the branch point to the 2 elements. The frequency of the new branch point is simply the sum of the frequencies of its two parts. Think about this for a  just a moment and it should make sense. The first time we do this the new element will look like</p><pre class="python-interpreter">
 (2, ((1, 'b'), (1, 'd')))
</pre><p>which is the branch point in the upper right of the tree leading to the characters 'b' and 'd'. Since both 'b' and 'd' have a frequency of 1, their branch point has a frequency of 2. Next we add this new element onto the list and resort it putting the new element (branch point) into its proper position in the list. The process is repeated. Each time two elements are replaced by one until the list has a single element which represents the complete tree.</p><p>Here is the Python function that does this. It's even less wordy than the above explanation.</p><pre class="python">
