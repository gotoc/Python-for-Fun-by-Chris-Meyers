translate expressions and statements in a python like mini-language
into assembly language for our MM computer.</p><h2>Motivation for Compilers<a name="auto0"></a></h2><p>The assembler certainly makes it easier to write machine
language programs but it would be still nicer to be able to
program with expressions like &quot;a=(a+b)*c&quot; instead of, say</p><pre class="shell">
   ld  r0,a
   ld  r1,b
   add r0,r1
   ld  r1,c
   mul r0,r1
   sto r0,a
</pre><p>So just as assemblers can assemble machine instructions from their
symbolic parts, compilers are programs to compile sets of
assembler instructions for more complex expressions. Some of
the earliest compilers were for the language Fortran which stands
for Formula Translation.  With Fortran a programmer could write
code much more concisely and easily than with assembler. The compiled
machine code was generally not quite as good as what could be
produced by hand in assembler but it was often good enough, even when machines
were absolutely miniscule by today's standards. Furthermore, knowing
Fortran (or other languages like Cobol or Algol) meant that a programmer could
write code for any computer that had the appropriate compiler, not
just for the computer for which one knew the assembler code. Today
the most common compiled language that produces machine
code for personal computers is probably C.</p><h2>Interpreters<a name="auto1"></a></h2><p>From the start there was also a parallel effort to design and build
interpreted languages. In general these languages do not try to
produce machine code directly but rather interpret instructions
that can do much more advanced operations than what the basic hardware
supports. Early interpreted languages include Basic, APL
(A Programming Language), and Lisp. Interpreted programs run much slower
than compiled programs but in general are often easier to write
and maintain. Python is an interpreted language and for programs
that easily translate from Python to C, the C version will often
run 30 to 50 times faster. But if we are doing the kinds of things
Python does well (our MM compiler is a good example) the speed difference
is less pronounced.
We often are quite willing to give up a little speed to gain some
very powerful operations that in turn result in consise code that
is easy to understand.</p><h2>The MH Compiler<a name="auto2"></a></h2><p>Our language, which we'll call MH, is designed to be as small as
possible but able to have programs like the factorial program from the
previous section. We'll have only interger variables
and, like Python, variables do not have to be declared.
Variables and numbers may be combined in expressions with
operators (+,-,*, and /) and anywhere a variable or number
may appear a subexpression in parentheses may be used instead.</p><p>In order to keep the compiler very small we'll support just two kinds of
basic statements; assignment and the &quot;while&quot; statement. In addition there is
a compound statement, a series of other
statements inside a pair of curly braces &quot;{\}&quot;.</p><p>So lots of stuff (most) is left out. But there is enough to write the simple
factorial program which will use most of the features just mentioned.
Near the end of this section will be some suggstions for extending
the language.</p><p>Let's look at an example program in MH.
Here is code for computing the factorial of 5.</p><pre class="shell">
term = 5
ans  = 1
while term { ans=ans*term  term=term-1 }
ans
</pre><p>As you can see, the program has some assignment statements and a
while statement. There is also a expression at the end whose purpose
will be explained later.
The 2 statements enclosed in curly braces form a single compound statement
that forms the body of the while statement. The test expression in the
while statement &quot;term&quot; will cause the statements in the body of
the while to be repeated until the value of term is zero.
This, of course, will cause the variable &quot;ans&quot; to be multiplied
by 5, 4, 3, 2, and finally 1.</p><p>Notice that unlike Python, statements do not need to be on
separate lines or indented. This syntax is closer to
the C language, with the exception that in C
statements are required to be terminated with a semicolon.</p><h2>The Compilation Process<a name="auto3"></a></h2><p>The compilation process consists of parsing the code in the
input language (MH) and then generating code in the target
language (MM assembly). The parsing phase itself consists of
two parts; identifying the tokens of the language such as
variables, numbers, keywords and special symbols, and then
determining how these tokens relate to one another to form
expressions and statements. Sometimes compilers will build
tree structure is to store these relationships but our
little compiler does not go to such lengths. As the various
pieces of input code come together output code is generated
somewhat on the fly. The reason we can do this is that the
grammer of our language is simple enough that the program
can be scanned and the structure determined by simply knowing
what has come so far and what the next token is to the right.</p><h2>A Simple Compiler in Python<a name="auto4"></a></h2><p>This is probably a good time to look over the <a href="compiler.py">compiler.py</a>
and either keep it in a separate window or make a
printout to follow the remainder of this discussion.</p><p>The function getToken extracts the next token from the
program and returns it along with the rest of the program.
It extracts keyword or variable names, numbers and special
symbols. Lets try it out on some input.</p><pre class="python-interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; import compiler
&gt;&gt;&gt; compiler.getToken(&quot;while a b=a&quot;)
['while', ' a b=a']
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre><p>So you can see that a call to getToken removed the
keyword &quot;while&quot; and returned it and the rest of the
program in a list. Let's look at the code in getToken
briefly. The string.strip function first removes whitespace
including spaces, tabs and newlines. Then the next character
is examined. If it is a letter then a word is gathered as in
the example above. If it is a digit, a string representing an
integer is returned. Finally a single character, perhaps an
&quot;+&quot;, &quot;=&quot;, or &quot;{&quot; is returned. In any case what is returned is
the next item of information that forms the structure of the
program.</p><p>If MH were extended we would want getToken smart enough to return
pairs of special characters like &quot;**&quot; or &quot;&lt;=&quot; as single tokens. You
might consider how you would do this. We would also need a way
to ignore comments in the program.</p><p>Let's look at the nature of possible statments in MH. The simplest
is an expression all by itself. An expression in MH is a series of &quot;terms&quot;
separated by an operator ('+','*',etc). &quot;Terms&quot; are numbers, variables,
or subexpressions enclosed in parentheses. Expressions and terms
are recursive structures and our functions &quot;getExpr&quot; and &quot;getTerm&quot;
call each other recursively as well.</p><p>This expression statement, which is also possible in Python, is a little
boring because it computes a value and then promptly throws it away.
An assignment statement however sets a variable to the value computed.
In MH only a simple variable is allowed on the lefthand side of the
assignment operator &quot;=&quot;.</p><p>A compound statment is a series of statements bracketed by &quot;{&quot; and
&quot;}&quot;. The inner statements may be assignments, while statements and
other compound statements.</p><p>
The while statment takes the form &quot;while &lt;expression&gt; &lt;statement&gt;&quot;. Here
&quot;&lt;statement&gt;&quot; is apt to be a compound statment and is repeated as
long as the &quot;&lt;expression&gt;&quot; evaluates to a nonzero value.
</p><h2>Some Sample Compilations<a name="auto5"></a></h2><p>It is useful to play with the compiler before examining the code
in detail. This will allow us to see what sort of assembly
code is produced. The compiler accepts a mini-program
on the command line (or standard input) and outputs the resultant assembly
code to standard output.</p><p>Let's look at what must be the simplest possible program. A single
statement which in turn is a single number, &quot;3&quot;.</p><pre class="shell">
$ python compiler.py &quot;3&quot;
  ld# r0,3
  hlt
</pre><p>The generated code simply loads the number 3 into register 0. In
general the compiler will generate code to get the result of any
expression into a chosen register, starting with 0 and working up
as it needs more registers. This, by the way, is why our MM architecture
includes 10 general registers. Let's look at a slightly more complex
expression, &quot;a*3&quot;. Note that it is necessary to quote the expression
to keep the shell from trying to evaluate special characters like
&quot;*&quot;.</p><pre class="shell">
$ python compiler.py &quot;a*3&quot;
  ld  r0,a
  ld# r1,3
  mul r0,r1
  hlt
</pre><p>Here the subexpression &quot;a&quot; is &quot;calculated&quot; in register 0 and the
subexpression &quot;3&quot; in register 1 (the next register).
Then the multiply instruction
leaves the result in register 0. Not shown here is a memory word
allocated to the variable &quot;a&quot;. Next, let's try a nested expression</p><pre class="shell">
$ python compiler.py &quot;(b+3)*a&quot;
  ld  r0,b
  ld# r1,3
  add r0,r1
  ld  r1,a
  mul r0,r1
</pre><p>This expression requires r0 and r1 to compute &quot;b+3&quot; and then reuses
register 1 to hold &quot;a&quot; before the multiply.</p><p>Let's extend this just a bit by compiling an assignment statement.
Now the output looks like this.</p><pre class="shell">
$ python compiler.py &quot;c=(b+3)*a&quot;
  ld  r0,b
  ld# r1,3
  add r0,r1
  ld  r1,a
  mul r0,r1
  sto r0,c
  hlt
c 0
</pre><p>The calculation is followed by &quot;sto r0,c&quot; which stores the result
of the computation into the variable &quot;c&quot;. Also a line was added to
allocate a word of memory for &quot;c&quot;. As we'll see, these allocations
all take place at the end of our program so they are out of the way
of the code. The compiler will remember to allocate a word of memory
for any variable that gets something assigned to it. That should include
all variables that we use.</p><p>Finally let's look at the output of a very simple while loop. It's not
meant to be a real one since the conditional term does not change. But it
will illustrate the code that is generated.</p><pre class="shell">
python compiler.py &quot;while a {b=b*c a=a-1}&quot;
z1
  ld  r0,a
  jz  r0,z2

  ld  r1,b
  ld  r2,c
  mul r1,r2
  sto r1,b

  ld  r1,a
  ld# r2,1
  sub r1,r2
  sto r1,a
  jmp  z1
z2
  hlt
a 0
b 0
</pre><p>The while loop uses the &quot;jump on zero&quot; machine instruction to jump out
of the loop and a simple jump to repeat the loop. It also generates
labels &quot;z1&quot; and &quot;z2&quot; for the destinations of the jump instructions. Later
while statements would generate labels like &quot;z3&quot;, &quot;z4&quot;, etc.</p><p>I've put in some blank lines to separate the code generated by the
different expressions. You should be able to recognize which parts belong
with what.</p><h2>A Closer Look at the Code<a name="auto6"></a></h2><p>We've already looked at &quot;getToken&quot;. Let's look at the other functions from
the top down.</p><p>Function &quot;main&quot; reads an entire program from either standard input or (as we've
seen) from the command line. It repeatably calls &quot;getStat&quot; to peel one
statement at a time from the program and print the resulting
assembly code. As we'll see the dictionary vars contains an entry for each
variable found and &quot;main&quot; reserves a word of memory for each.</p><p>Like &quot;getToken&quot; the 3 other functions &quot;getStat&quot;, &quot;getTerm&quot; and &quot;getExpr&quot; return
two values; the assembly code generated and the remainder of the program
still to be compiled.</p><p>Function &quot;getStat&quot; looks at the first token. If it is &quot;while&quot; it gets
an expression for the condition test, putting the assembly code into
string &quot;code1&quot;, and another statement (calling itself recursively) for
the body (in &quot;code2&quot;). It then makes two unique lables in &quot;l1&quot; and &quot;l2&quot;
and combines all to produce the code which is returned along with the
rest of the program. Other sections of &quot;getStat&quot; handle the assignment
statement, compound statments and a single expression. Part of compiling
an assignment statement is to add an entry to the &quot;vars&quot; dictionary for
each variable on the left of the &quot;=&quot;.</p><p>By this point the remaining two functions, &quot;getExpr&quot; and &quot;getTerm&quot; should
be fairly straightforward. The only tricky bit is the mutual recursion between
them. Expressions consist of terms which may be variables, numbers or
subexpressions in parentheses separated by operators.
If you are confused run the test above with some &quot;print&quot; statements inserted.</p><h2>Compiling and Assembling the Factorial Program<a name="auto7"></a></h2><p>Now let's compile the factorial program at the top of this section and
produce MM code that can be run in the simulator. We'll start by placing
the following MH code into a file called &quot;fact.mh&quot;</p><pre class="shell">
term = 5
ans  = 1
while term { ans=ans*term  term=term-1 }
ans
</pre><p>On Unix it is possible to run the compiler and assembler together since both
are using standard input and standard output. In fact many compilers take advantage
of this. Here is our factorial program ready to load into the simulator.</p><pre class="shell">
$ python compiler.py &lt; fact.mh | python assembler.py
100 030005     ld# r0,5
101 020117     sto r0,term
102 030001     ld# r0,1
103 020118     sto r0,ans
             z1
104 010117     ld  r0,term
105 110115     jz  r0,z2
106 011118     ld  r1,ans
107 012117     ld  r2,term
108 071002     mul r1,r2
109 021118     sto r1,ans
110 011117     ld  r1,term
111 032001     ld# r2,1
112 061002     sub r1,r2
113 021117     sto r1,term
114 100104     jmp  z1
             z2
115 010118     ld  r0,ans
116 000000     hlt
117 000000   term 0
118 000000   ans 0
</pre><p>The last statement of the program is simply the expression &quot;ans&quot;. As you can see this
loads it into general register zero where it can be observed in the simulator.
The following creates a machine language file and runs it in the simulator.</p><pre class="shell">
  python compiler.py &lt; fact.mh | python assembler.py &gt;fact.mm
  python simulator.py fact.mm
</pre><h2>Further considerations<a name="auto8"></a></h2><p>It is interesting to compare the assembly language output from the compiler with
the assembly language program for computing factorials that we built in the
previous section. The hand built version is about half the size of the
compiler output. For a long time people continued to program in assembler just
for this advantage. The space advantage is also a runtime advantage. Smaller programs
run faster with fewer instructions to execute.
Later, compilers were made to optimize their output and that closed the gap somewhat.</p><p>Our compiler treats all operators that it supports with the same precedence. You
can see this by compiling &quot;a*b+c&quot; and &quot;a*(b+c)&quot;. They produce the same code. To
fix this &quot;getExpr&quot; must be broken into separate functions for each precedence
level. Sums can be products separated by &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; operators. Products are
terms separated by &quot;*&quot; and &quot;/&quot;. There are several other levels,
exponentiation and logical operations, even array access.</p><p>Defining functions and calling them with arguments demands operations that work
with stacks. Stacks may also be used in lieu of multiple registers for computing
nested expressions and then combining them later. Compilers are sometimes
defined as being either stack oriented or register oriented. In fact the
way our compiler uses successive registers is very similar to using
a stack.</p><p>Our compiler does not support function calls or definitions. Typically
when a function is
called its arguments are evaluated and pushed onto a stack. The function is
then invoked saving the return address as well, either on the same stack
or on another. When
the function returns the arguments are popped from the stack and the function
return value is pushed.</p><p>Python, Java and some other languages perform what they call compilation, but
instead of compiling to machine code they compile to an intermediate code that
is then interpreted very much like our simulator program works. However
the basic operations in this code are much more powerful than our
machine instructions. Here strings can be added, dictionaries accessed
and so on. In python compilation happens automatically. When you
import a module Python will try to save the compiled code in a file with
the &quot;pyc&quot; extension. The Python interpreter
then takes over to run the code. With Java the interpreters are available in
web browsers which load compiled Java classes and run them. These interpreters
go by the name of &quot;Java Virtual Machine&quot;. There is also a Python compiler called
Jython written in Java that translates Python source code into Java classes.</p>
