In the last <a href="simulator.html">section</a> we looked at a simulator
program for the Mythical Machine. In this section and the next we'll see
how software evolved to make programming computers much easier.

<h2>Problems with Machine Language<a name="auto0"></a></h2>

Programming in machine language is tedious for some obvious reasons. One is
that you have to keep track of the numerical operation codes and not
choose the wrong one. In coding the little programs of the last section we
cheated a bit in that our format allowed us to put a comment after
the address and assembled instruction which
the simulator simply ignored. Without those comments the code would be
extruciating to follow.</p><p>Another problem occurs if we are assembling a jump instruction. We only know
the target address if the jump is back to a previous instruction. If the jump
is forward to an instruction yet to come then we probably don't know
what the address will be. So we have to come back later to complete the
jump instruction.</p><p>But here is the worst problem. Suppose our initial code contains errors
that require more (or fewer) instructions to fix. Then some jump instructions
may have the wrong target addresses when the code is fixed and other instructions
get shifted in memory. A major headache.

One quick and dirty approach to this problem was apply what was called a binary
patch. Where the code change occurred, we replaced whatever instruction
was presently there with a jump to some available memory. At that address we
put the replaced instruction, any new instructions and finally a jump
back to the original spot. That saved other jumps around the patch from needing
modification but code like this very quickly becomes messy
and unmanagable.</p><h2>Assembler Programs<a name="auto1"></a></h2><p>The answer to these problems was to create &quot;assembler&quot; programs that
let us represent the operation codes, registers, and addresses
symbolically and let this program assemble the numeric instructions
for us. When changes are made in the program, the assembler code is 
modified and the entire program re-assembled to machine code.</p><p>In assembler pieces of each instruction are represented in a way
that is much more readable to humans.
For example &quot;add r1,r2&quot; could mean add register 2 to register 1.
The assembler would assemble the opcode (05) with the 2 register arguments
to create the instruction 051002. Jump destinations and data addresses are determined
by applying a label to an instruction or data point. This will be clearer with an
example. Here is the assembly language version of our
previous program to add a list of numbers together.</p><pre class="shell">
go    ld#  r0,0      register 0 will hold the sum, init it
      ld#  r1,nums   register 1 points to the numbers to add
      ld#  r2,1      register 2 holds the number one.
loop  ldi  r3,r1     get next number into register 3
      jz   r3,done   if its zero we're finished
      add  r0,r3     otherwise add it to the sum
      add  r1,r2     add one to register one (next number to load)
      jmp  loop      go for the next one
done  hlt  00        all done. sum is in register 0
nums  123            the numbers to add
      234
      345
        0            end of the list
</pre><p>You may already see what is going on here. The symbols r1,r2 represent
the general registers. The symbols &quot;ld#&quot;, &quot;ldi&quot;, &quot;ldr&quot;, &quot;jz&quot;, &quot;jmp&quot;
and &quot;hlt&quot; are operation codes we are using. Finally the symbols go&quot;,
&quot;loop&quot;, &quot;done&quot; and &quot;nums&quot; are labels arbitrarily chosen to
represent memory addresses. We don't
know what those memory addresses will be and we don't really care.
The assembler program will figure that out for us.</p><p>Each line has the information for the assembler to build a single machine
instruction. One, two, or three fields may be followed by an optional comment.
In the first line the label &quot;go&quot; will make the symbol &quot;go&quot;
the same as the address of this instruction. A label starts at the
beginning of the line with no white space preceding it. The second field is
the operation code &quot;ld#&quot; (load number) and the third field &quot;r0,0&quot; provides the
information to complete the instruction. Some instructions require both
a register and address argument, &quot;jmp&quot; requires only an address, and
&quot;hlt&quot; needs no argument at all. Finally, the operation code may be replaced by
a simple number which lets us put data into the program.</p><h2>An Assembler for MM in Python<a name="auto2"></a></h2><p>If you haven't already get a printout
of the <a href="assembler.py">program code for the MM Assembler</a>
or put it into another window.</p><p>The assembler works in two passes. The first pass
determines what address values need to be assigned for each of our
labels. These are stored in the dictionary &quot;lookup&quot; along with the
register definitions.</p><p>The second pass uses the opcode field and argument field
to build instructions, substituting lables in the argument field
with their numeric addresses.</p><p>Assemblers usually take an input file with contents like the above and
produce two output files. One is the machine language
in a form that the computer can load for execution. Generally it is combined
with others that are &quot;linked&quot; to form a complete
executable program. The other output is a listing file that would look like the
following.</p><pre class="shell">
100 030000   go    ld#  r0,0      reg 0 will hold the sum
101 031107         ld#  r1,nums   reg 1 points to next num
102 042001   loop  ldi  r2,r1     get next number into reg 2
103 112106         jz   r2,done   if its zero we're done
104 050002         add  r0,r2     else add it to the sum
105 100102         jmp  loop      go for the next one
106 000000   done  hlt            all done. sum is in reg 0
107 000123   nums  123            the numbers to add
108 000234         234
109 000345         345
110 000000           0            zero marks the end
</pre><p>Function &quot;main&quot; reads the entire program from standard input to a
list of lines and then passes the list to functions &quot;pass1&quot; and &quot;pass2&quot;.</p><p>The function &quot;pass1&quot; looks at each line of the program.
Any label in the instruction
is equated to the current value of the program counter in the dictionary
&quot;lookup&quot;.  Then if a valid opcode
is found the program counter is advanced since there
will be an instruction generated from this line in pass 2.</p><p>The function &quot;pass2&quot; looks at each line again and this time assembles the
instructions since all labels have had their values set in
the &quot;lookup&quot; dictionary. The operation code for each instruction is
either an opcode in &quot;codes&quot; or a simple number. Anything else raises an
error and will show as &quot;***&quot; on the output.</p><p>It is ok to have a label alone on a line. This makes it possible
to have several symbols equated to the same address. We will use this
feature in the next section when we develop a tiny compiler for MM.</p><h2>Other Considerations<a name="auto3"></a></h2><p>There are a couple of things that should be pointed out. Our assembler
creates code that is then loaded directly into our computer (or simulator)
in an address space determined by the assembler. In real life final
addressing is actually determined later by another program called the
&quot;linker&quot;. The machine code is also designed to facilitate this. Instead
of actual addresses in the instructions, it's more likely that an offset
from the current instruction would be used. So that &quot;jmp loop&quot; would
not use the address 102, but rather -3. This complicates other things
because now we would need two different instructions for &quot;ld# r0,0&quot; and
&quot;ld# r0,nums&quot; since in the first instance we really want the number zero
but in the second case we want whatever the final address of &quot;nums&quot; will
be.</p><p>However there is a tremendous advantage to code like this. It may
be loaded anywhere in memory, and the
linker program may link together many separate modules to create a
single executable. On modern systems it is even possible to load modules
at runtime and link them together. In fact, this is exactly what you
do whenver you import a module into your Python program
that was written in the C language and compiled to machine code.</p>
