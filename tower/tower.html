recursion.</p><p>The game runs as follows. There are a number of discs each with a hole in the center. Each
disc can fit on any of 3 pegs and each peg is high enough to hold all the discs in a
stack. In the initial configuration all the discs are stacked on the first peg with the
largest disc on the bottom and the smallest on top. A disc is never stacked on top of a
smaller disc. The problem is to move the discs, one at a time from peg to peg in such a
way that this is always true and to finally end up with all of the discs on peg 3 in
the original order.</p><p>The solution is elegant. Let's call the three pegs A, B, and C. If you don't know how to
move 5 discs from A to C (using B for intermediate storage), then just move 4 discs from
A to B, one disk from A to C (this is really easy) and then move 4 discs from B to C.
Can't do 4 discs? Well then, move just 3 ...</p><p>Guido's hanoi.py in the Python Demo area is a nice demonstration of this recursive process.
The heart of the program is just this.</p><pre class="python">

Here is a screen shot of the game in progress.</p><p><img src="hanoi.gif" /></p><p>I've tried a couple of times to teach the Hanoi puzzle as a good example of recursion.
It is much better than the usual factorial example which does nothing more than
use recursion to replace a simple for loop.
But students have a hard time getting it. And I think the problem is the difficulty in
visualizing the nested context of the recursive calls.</p><p>The recursion can be avoided, or at least made more intuative  by using an object
oriented approach. Then the discs, as objects, can hold the information normally held
in the call stack.</p><p>Lets think of the discs as being animated and that we can request one of them to move
itself, along with all of the smaller brethen above it, to another peg.
We'll have each disc use
the following strategy. If there is no smaller disc on top, simply move to the requested
peg. But if there is, pass the buck. First ask the smaller disc above you to move to
the alternate peg (along with its brethren above, if any), make your move, and finally
ask the same disc to now move to your peg. When that is done, declare success. Each
disc will need only to talk to the one just smaller</p><p>It might prove instructive to have
the game played in a classroom with a different student playing the role of
each disc. It might be a good idea to choose students by height to represent larger or
smaller discs so that it is easy to see that the rules are being followed. Have 3 lines (A,B,C)
that the students can stand in and initially line them up on A, tallest to
shortest. Finally ask the tallest student representing the largest disc
to move to line C.</p><p>Each student must follow these instructions exactly. It's probably a good idea that each
have their own copy and use a pencil to keep track of exactly where they are at all times.</p><pre class="shell">
 If you are requested to move to another line then
   If no one is in front, move to that line and say &quot;OK&quot;.
 Otherwise
   Ask the person in front of you to move to the alternate line
     (not the one you will move to).
   Wait for that person to say &quot;OK&quot;.
   Move to line you were requested to.
   Ask the same person to move to the line you are now on.
   Wait for that person to say &quot;OK&quot;
 Say &quot;OK&quot;
</pre><p>Play this game with 1, 2, 3, and 4 players. How many total moves are made in each case?
How many moves would you expect for 5 players? 10 players? The monks of Hanoi were
said to play the game with 64 discs and when finished, the universe would end. How well
does this jive with current cosmology? ;)</p><p><a href="tower.py">Click here to view the source code of tower.py</a>. It is a small python program
that essentially follows these instructions.
Here is a sample run when we import it.</p><pre class="shell">
