was simply imported. The phone list was a list of lists where each sublist
contained the name and phone number.</p><p>This was very convenient when keeping the code as small as possible is the
primary concern. The Python compiler becomes the parser for the input data
and the &quot;str&quot; function can format the entire phonelist in order to write
it back to the disc.</p><p>Another simple way to store the phone list might be in a text file with one
entry per line. This would require more code of our own to convert this
file to (and from) the internal format but would be useful in other ways.
For one it would be easier to edit with a standard text editor like emacs
or vi. For another, simple utilities like &quot;grep&quot; could be used for rapid
searching from a command line. That is unless the phone list grows to the
size of a phone book.</p><p>For more sophisticated data storage we need more. If several people are
using our GUI at the same time to update phone numbers, we would like to
see those changes immediately and have the changes made by one person
not interfere with those of another. If two people pull up the phone list
and make changes to seperate records, the second person to save the phone list
back to the disc will wipe out the change made by the first person.</p><p>SQL databases will synchornize update and offer many other features besides.</p><p>We'll look at a very simple example of using Mysql with our phone list.
Another tutorial is available oriented around <a href="../sql/sql.html">
PostSql</a></p><p><h2>Just enough SQL<a name="auto0"></a></h2></p><p>Mysql, like other database systems, is a client/server application. The
server program (or daemon) is called &quot;mysqld&quot; and it actually does all of
reading and writing to the disc. Client programs then request actions from
the daemon, such as inserting, updating, deleting or just searching for
data.</p><p>A standard client, the program &quot;mysql&quot;, lets you interact directly with the
database daemon thru the keyboard or other <code>stdin</code> input.</p><p>A database consists of tables which in turn consists of rows and columns.
Columns in a table are fields such as &quot;name&quot; and &quot;phone&quot;. Each column has
a datatype such as varchar (roughly equivalent to a Python string but with
a maximum length) or integer. For our gui we are going to make a table
called &quot;phones&quot; with 2 varchar columns called &quot;name&quot; and &quot;phone&quot;. Our table
will be part of the database &quot;test&quot; which comes built-in.</p><p>Unless the mysql daemon is already running you may have to start it. If you
get an error message when running mysql, check with your system administrator.</p><pre class="shell">
mysql&gt;use test;
mysql&gt;show tables;
Empty Set (0.00 sec)
</pre><p>The commands requested the daemon to use the &quot;test&quot; database and then
to show tables in the test database. Since we haven't created any (nor has
anyone else) it is currently empty.</p><p><h2>Creating our table<a name="auto1"></a></h2></p><p>Creating a table involves listing the name and type of each column.</p><pre class="shell">
mysql&gt; create table phones (id int, name varchar(20), phone varchar(12));
</pre><p>Our table &quot;phones&quot; has 3 fields; id, name, and phone. The
integer &quot;id&quot; field will be used as a handle on a row. All rows will be
assigned a unique id, just increasing numbers. It will become clearer why
this is a good idea as we proceed. Once our table is created the &quot;describe&quot;
command shows off its structure. Don't worry about the last 4 columns.</p><pre class="shell">
mysql&gt; describe phones;

+-------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+-------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| id    | int(11)     | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| name  | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| phone | varchar(12) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+-------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
3 rows in set (0.11 sec)
</pre><p><h2>Inserting data into the table<a name="auto2"></a></h2></p><p>The SQL insert command lets us populate the table with rows. Here is an
example.</p><pre class="shell">
insert into  phones values (1,'Meyers, Chris',  '343-4349');
</pre><p>We supply values for id, name and phone. Incidentally there is another
format for the insert command where only designated columns are set and
other columns are set to a default value or null (equivalent to None
in Python).</p><p>The files <a href="phones.sql">phones.sql</a> contains commands to create the
database and populate it with insert commands. It may be piped to the client
program &quot;mysql&quot; to initialize the database table.</p><pre class="shell">
mysql &lt;phones.sql
</pre><p><h2>Accessing data in the table<a name="auto3"></a></h2></p><p>The SQL select command lets us find data we are interested in. The simplest
format will dump the entire table.</p><pre class="shell">
mysql&gt; select * from phones;
+------+-----------------+----------+
| id   | name            | phone    |
+------+-----------------+----------+
|    1 | Meyers, Chris   | 343-4349 |
|    2 | Smith, Robert   | 689-1234 |
|    3 | Jones, Janet    | 483-5432 |
|    4 | Barnhart, Ralph | 683-2341 |
|    5 | Nelson, Eric    | 485-2689 |
|    6 | Prefect, Ford   | 987-6543 |
|    7 | Zigler, Mary    | 567-8901 |
|    8 | Smith, Bob      | 689-1234 |
+------+-----------------+----------+
8 rows in set (0.11 sec)
</pre><p>But we can be more restrictive by using a &quot;where&quot; clause. For example.</p><pre class="shell">
mysql&gt; select * from phones where id=6;
+------+---------------+----------+
| id   | name          | phone    |
+------+---------------+----------+
|    6 | Prefect, Ford | 987-6543 |
+------+---------------+----------+
1 row in set (0.05 sec)
</pre><p>We can also request just certain columns.</p><pre class="shell">
mysql&gt; select name,phone from phones where name like &quot;Smith%&quot;;
+---------------+----------+
| name          | phone    |
+---------------+----------+
| Smith, Robert | 689-1234 |
| Smith, Bob    | 689-1234 |
+---------------+----------+
2 rows in set (0.05 sec)
</pre><p>Here the &quot;%&quot; is the wildcard character.</p><p><h2>Updating data in the table<a name="auto4"></a></h2></p><p>The SQL update command is used to change column values in rows specified by
a &quot;where&quot; clause. Here is an example.</p><pre class="shell">
mysql&gt; update phones set name='Chase, Chevy' where id=6;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.06 sec)

mysql&gt; select * from phones where id=6;
+------+--------------+----------+
| id   | name         | phone    |
+------+--------------+----------+
|    6 | Chase, Chevy | 987-6543 |
+------+--------------+----------+
1 row in set (0.06 sec)
</pre><p><h2>Deleting rows from the table<a name="auto5"></a></h2></p><p>Finally, the SQL delete command will erase any rows matching the &quot;where&quot;
clause. If there is no where clause, all rows are deleted.</p><pre class="shell">
mysql&gt; delete from phones where id=6;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.05 sec)

mysql&gt; select * from phones;
+------+-----------------+----------+
| id   | name            | phone    |
+------+-----------------+----------+
|    1 | Meyers, Chris   | 343-4349 |
|    2 | Smith, Robert   | 689-1234 |
|    3 | Jones, Janet    | 483-5432 |
|    4 | Barnhart, Ralph | 683-2341 |
|    5 | Nelson, Eric    | 485-2689 |
|    7 | Zigler, Mary    | 567-8901 |
|    8 | Smith, Bob      | 689-1234 |
+------+-----------------+----------+
7 rows in set (0.00 sec)
</pre><p>It should now be clear why the id column is important. If we want to be sure
we are modifying or deleting a single row, this provides a mechanism. We may
have a given name in the table more than once (maybe she has a cellphone) and
the phone number may linked to multiple people (a house phone).</p><p><h2>Python and MySQL<a name="auto6"></a></h2></p><p>A Python program may be an sql client as well. In fact, the interface has
much the same look and feel as the standard mysql client. A few examples
will demonstate. We'll start by creating a connection object called db and
telling it to use the test database.</p><pre class="shell">
&gt;&gt;&gt; import MySQL
&gt;&gt;&gt; db = MySQL.connect('')
&gt;&gt;&gt; db.selectdb(&quot;test&quot;)
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre><p>Next let's do a query. The variable &quot;c&quot; is set to a cursor object which can
fetch rows for us in a list of lists. The data is returned in the same format
as in the previous program.</p><pre class="shell">
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = db.query(&quot;select * from phones&quot;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; rows = c.fetchrows()
&gt;&gt;&gt; for row in rows : print row
...
[1, 'Meyers, Chris', '343-4349']
[2, 'Smith, Robert', '689-1234']
[3, 'Jones, Janet', '483-5432']
[4, 'Barnhart, Ralph', '683-2341']
[5, 'Nelson, Eric', '485-2689']
[7, 'Zigler, Mary', '567-8901']
[8, 'Smith, Bob', '689-1234']
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre><p>Although we won't use it in the program, the cursor object may also retrieve
a list of dictionaries. This can be more convenient since we don't have
worry about which column is in which position.</p><pre class="shell">
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = c.fetchdict()
&gt;&gt;&gt; for row in d : print row
...
{'phones.name': 'Meyers, Chris', 'phones.phone': '343-4349', 'phones.id': 1}
{'phones.name': 'Smith, Robert', 'phones.phone': '689-1234', 'phones.id': 2}
{'phones.name': 'Jones, Janet', 'phones.phone': '483-5432', 'phones.id': 3}
{'phones.name': 'Barnhart, Ralph', 'phones.phone': '683-2341', 'phones.id': 4}
{'phones.name': 'Nelson, Eric', 'phones.phone': '485-2689', 'phones.id': 5}
{'phones.name': 'Zigler, Mary', 'phones.phone': '567-8901', 'phones.id': 7}
{'phones.name': 'Smith, Bob', 'phones.phone': '689-1234', 'phones.id': 8}
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre><p>Inserting, updating and deleting rows is, by comparsion, quite simple. We
just pass the command to db.query and, voila, it happens.</p><pre class="shell">
&gt;&gt;&gt; db.query(&quot;update phones set phone='338-1233' where id=1&quot;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = db.query(&quot;select * from phones where id=1&quot;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; c.fetchrows()
[[1, 'Meyers, Chris', '338-1233']]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre><p><h2>Adapting our GUI for SQL<a name="auto7"></a></h2></p><p>The changes required to use mysql with our GUI are actually fairly minor.
<a href="sqlPhone.py">Click here to see the full code.</a> Let's look at the changes
one at a time.</p><p>At the top of the program we import MySQL and set up a database connection to
the test database.</p><pre class="shell">
import MySQL
db = MySQL.connect('')
db.selectdb(&quot;test&quot;)
</pre><p>Let's look next at the function &quot;setSelect&quot; which fills in our list control.
Here, instead of importing the phone list, we simply use fetchrows to get
the same list of lists.</p><pre class="shell">
def setSelect () :
global phoneList
c = db.query(&quot;select id,name,phone from phones order by name&quot;)
phoneList = c.fetchrows()
select.delete(0,END)
for id,name,phone in phoneList :
select.insert (END, name)
</pre><p>All other SQL commands are channeled to the function &quot;dosql&quot; which makes
sure setSelect is called after the update, delete or insert happens. This
also catch any changes made in the meantime by other users. For learner
feedback &quot;dosql&quot; also prints the sql command to the launch window.</p><p>About the only other feature worth remarking on is the generation of new id
numbers as new rows are inserted.</p><pre class="shell">
c = db.query(&quot;select max(id)+1 from phones&quot;)
id = c.fetchdict()[0].values()[0]
</pre><p>The SQL max function does what you would expect. Adding one gives us a new
unique id to be used in the insert immediately following.</p><p>There is a potential problem with this however. If hundreds of users were
using the program at the same time, two might inadvertantly fetch the same
&quot;max(id)+1&quot; before either does their insert. Then we would have two rows in
the table with the same id; something we definitely don't want. Databases
have ways of dealing with these &quot;racing&quot; conditions, from providing automatic
id columns to transaction processing, where multiple SQL statements can be
guarenteed concurrent (and non-interrupted) execution.</p>
