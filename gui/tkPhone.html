we can use to maintain a simple phone list. On the way we'll play around with
several Tkinter widgets thru the Python interactive prompt, hopefully getting
a good feel for how all the pieces work together. Then we'll study a functional
event driven GUI program.</p><p>It's best if you follow along with Python in another window and watch the
widgets come and go and move around. Make sure you are using the ordinary
python.exe executable and not one of the IDE like IDLE or PythonWin. Sometimes
the graphics they are doing will interfere with the graphics we are creating
resulting in some odd behaviour.</p><p>The amount of Tk that is introduced in this tutorial is small but surprisingly
effective for many applications. However, you will also want to have a
good reference to find out about other widgets such as check boxes and radio
buttons as well as how to extend the functionality of the widgets being
introduced here.</p><p><h2>Playing with buttons<a name="auto0"></a></h2></p><p>The first thing to do is to import the Tkinter module. Generally this is done
by importing the module into our local namespace so that we can use the
classes and constants by their names (like Label, Button, TOP) instead of
having to constantly qualify everything (like Tkinter.Label, Tkinter.Button,
Tkinter.TOP). So lets do that first.</p><pre class="python-interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; from Tkinter import *
</pre><p>Now if this produced an error message it means that either Tk/Tcl is not
installed on your system or that Python is not linked to it. You will need to
fix that before going on and that will probably involve your system administrator.
Otherwise, if all is quiet, try the first command which will create
a window and assign it to the variable &quot;win&quot;.</p><pre class="python-interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; win=Tk()
</pre><p>You should now have a small window on your screen with &quot;tk&quot; in the title
bar. Let's create a couple of buttons for this window</p><pre class="python-interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; b1 = Button(win,text=&quot;One&quot;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b2 = Button(win,text=&quot;Two&quot;)
</pre><p>The class Button takes the parent window as the first argument. As we
will see later other objects, such as frames, may also act as parents. The
rest of the arguments are passed by keyword and are all optional.</p><p>You might be surprised that the buttons did not appear in the window. They
must first be placed with one of the so called geometry managers. The two most common
ones are &quot;pack&quot; and &quot;grid&quot;.</p><p><h2>Using the Pack Manager<a name="auto1"></a></h2></p><p>With &quot;pack&quot; you tell your widget to pack itself into its parent. You may
specify a side (TOP, LEFT, RIGHT, BOTTOM) and your widget will
be packed against either the parents wall or a previous widget with the same
packing. If you don't specify a side the default is TOP. Do the following.</p><pre class="python-interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; b1.pack()
&gt;&gt;&gt; b2.pack()
</pre><p>Notice that after the first command the button is placed in the window and
the window itself is
shrunk to the size of the button. When the second button is packed the window
is expanded to accomodate it. The default TOP stacked them vertically in the
order they were packed.</p><p><img src="g1.jpeg" /></p><p>Now try the following two commands.</p><pre class="python-interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; b2.pack(side=LEFT)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b1.pack(side=LEFT)
</pre><p>Now the buttons look like</p><p><img src="g2.jpeg" /></p><p>In practice the pack geometry manager is generally used in one of these two
modes to place a set of widgets in either a vertical column or horizontal
row.</p><p>Our buttons look a little squished. We can fix that by packing them with a
little padding. &quot;padx&quot; adds pixels to the left and right and &quot;pady&quot; adds
them to the top and bottom.</p><pre class="python-interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; b1.pack(side=LEFT,padx=10)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b2.pack(side=LEFT,padx=10)
</pre><p><img src="g3.jpeg" /></p><p>I suggest you create a couple more buttons and play with BOTTOM and RIGHT to
get a good feel for the &quot;pack&quot; manager.</p><p><h2>Using the Grid Manager<a name="auto2"></a></h2></p><p>Another way to place widgets (buttons, labels and whatnot) is in a table or grid.
Here the parent window is divided into rows and columns and each widget is placed
in a given cell. The grid manager
keeps track of how many row and columns are actually needed and fills out the window
accordingly. It also keeps track of how wide each column, and how tall each row must
be to accomodate the largest widget in that row or column. Rows do not all have to be
the same height and columns do not have to all be the same width.</p><p>Let's make a new window with the same buttons but this time lay them out in a two
by two grid.</p><pre class="python-interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; win = Tk()
&gt;&gt;&gt; b1 = Button(win,text=&quot;One&quot;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b2 = Button(win,text=&quot;Two&quot;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b1.grid(row=0, column=0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b2.grid(row=1, column=1)
</pre><p><img src="g4.jpeg" /></p><p>You can see that some empty space is left since nothing was put into row 0, column 1 or
into row1, column 0. Let's use this as an oppurtunity to look at a new widget type.</p><p>A label widget is used to place text into the window and is very simple.</p><pre class="python-interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; l = Label(win, text=&quot;This is a label&quot;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; l.grid(row=1,column=0)
</pre><p><img src="g5.jpeg" /></p><p>Notice how the label pushed the width of column 0 out to accomodate the text.</p><p><h2>More complex layouts.<a name="auto3"></a></h2></p><p>A frame is a widget whose sole purpose is to contain other widgets.
Groups of widgets, whether packed or placed in a grid, may be combined into a
single Frame. Frames may then be packed with other widgets and frames. This feature
lets us create just about any kind of layout. As an example let's place a lable over
3 buttons in a row. We'll first pack the buttons into a frame horizontally and then
pack the label and frame vertically in the window.</p><pre class="python-interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; win = Tk()
&gt;&gt;&gt; f = Frame(win)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b1 = Button(f, &quot;One&quot;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b2 = Button(f, &quot;Two&quot;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b3 = Button(f, &quot;Three&quot;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b1.pack(side=LEFT)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b2.pack(side=LEFT)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b3.pack(side=LEFT)
&gt;&gt;&gt; l = Label(win,&quot;This label is over all buttons&quot;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; l.pack()
&gt;&gt;&gt; f.pack()
</pre><p><img src="g6.jpeg" /></p><p>In addition to pack and grid there is a place method to position a widget at a precise
location within a frame or window. It is not often used because it is frankly easier to
let pack and grid just spread things out as needed, especially if you use the mouse
to shrink or expand a window.</p><p>There are other keyword arguments that are common when using either pack or grid.
We saw padx and pady above. With
grids there is a &quot;sticky&quot; parameter which takes a map coordinate like N, E, S, W, NE,
etc. If the grid cell is larger than your widget because a larger widget is in
the same row or column, sticky helps you put the widget where you want it in the cell.</p><p>At this point you might want to check out your reference guide and play with other
keyword parameters from the interactive prompt in order to get a good feel for how
they function.</p><p><h2>Bringing the buttons to life.<a name="auto4"></a></h2></p><p>You may have tried clicking the buttons. If so, you noticed that they highlight and
depress fine but they just don't do anything. Let's fix that.</p><p>As we've seen, widgets are objects and have methods. We've been using their pack
and grid methods. Now we'll use a new method, &quot;configure&quot;.</p><p>Any keyword argument that we can pass when creating a widget may also be passed to
its &quot;configure&quot; method. For example, if we do the following</p><pre class="python-interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; b1.configure(text=&quot;Uno&quot;)
</pre><p>suddenly our window looks like</p><p><img src="g7.jpeg" /></p><p>Buttons are tied to callback functions using the parameter &quot;command&quot; either when the
button is created or with configure. Let's start by defining a function that simply
prints a message</p><pre class="python-interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; def but1() : print &quot;Button one was pushed&quot;
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; b1.configure(command=but1)
</pre><p>Now when we click button &quot;Uno&quot; the message is printed.</p><p><h2>Entry widgets<a name="auto5"></a></h2></p><p>To input text from the user we use an entry widget.
Just as in the case of buttons we need some way to communicate with the entry widget,
in this case to set and retrieve text. This is done with a special Tkinter object
called a StringVar that simply holds a string of text and allows us to set its
contents and read it (with get). Let's start with a clean window.</p><pre class="python-interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; win = Tk()
&gt;&gt;&gt; v = StringVar()
&gt;&gt;&gt; e = Entry(win,textvariable=v)
&gt;&gt;&gt; e.pack()
</pre><p>Now let's type &quot;this is a test&quot; into the entry and then retrieve it from
our linked StringVar object</p><p><img src="g8.jpeg" /></p><pre class="python-interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; v.get()
&quot;this is a test&quot;
</pre><p>We can also set text into our StringVar object and have it appear in the entry widget.</p><pre class="python-interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; v.set(&quot;this is set from the program&quot;)
</pre><p><img src="g9.jpeg" /></p><p><h2>The Listbox widget<a name="auto6"></a></h2></p><p>Our last widget in the project will let us have a menu of items to choose from.
A listbox is created with the following command (after opening a window).
The &quot;height&quot; parameter limits how many lines will show.</p><pre class="python-interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; win = Tk()
&gt;&gt;&gt; lb = Listbox(win, height=3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; lb.pack()
&gt;&gt;&gt; lb.insert(END,&quot;first entry&quot;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; lb.insert(END,&quot;second entry&quot;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; lb.insert(END,&quot;third entry&quot;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; lb.insert(END,&quot;fourth entry&quot;)
</pre><p><img src="g10.jpeg" /></p><p>The fourth entry doesn't show since the listbox is set to just 3 lines.</p><p>Items in the listbox may be also inserted not only at the end (END) but also
at the begining or even the middle. They
may also be deleted. In fact we'll use the command &quot;lb.delete(0,END)&quot; later to
clear the listbox.</p><p>A listbox may be used in conjunction with a scroll bar. Let's start by
making a scroll bar and packing it next to the list box.</p><pre class="python-interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; sb = Scrollbar(win,orient=VERTICAL)
&gt;&gt;&gt; sb.pack(side=LEFT,fill=Y)
</pre><p><img src="g11.jpeg" /></p><p>This looks good but if you operate the scroll bar you'll see that it doesn't
do anything yet. The scroll bar and the list box need to know about each other.
This is done in a manner similar to how we tied buttons to call back functions.
Two calls are needed, one to tell each about the other.</p><pre class="python-interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; sb.configure(command=lb.yview)
&gt;&gt;&gt; lb.configure(yscrollcommand=sb.set)
</pre><p>Now manipulate the scroll bar and see the listbox respond.</p><p><img src="g12.jpeg" /></p><p>If you have selected an item in the listbox, the method curselection will
return it for you. Actually it returns a tuple of items selected. It is
possible to configure the listbox to allow multiple items to be selected
together. An empty tuple is returned if no item is selected. Otherwise
the tuple contains the index(es) of the selected items. (but as strings!)</p><p>For example, click on the 3rd item and do the following. In typical Python
fashion indexes start at zero.</p><pre class="python-interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; lb.curselection()
('2',)
</pre><p><h2>Putting it all together.<a name="auto7"></a></h2></p><p>Our phone list editor uses all of the features discussed so far plus a few
more that we'll touch on. Here is a view of the running application.</p><p><img src="g13.jpeg" /></p><p>Now would be a good time to bring to bring up the python source in another
window or make a printout. <a href="tkPhone.py">Click here to view the source</a>.
<a href="phones.py">Click here to see the initial phone list</a>.</p><p>The variable &quot;phonelist&quot; is a list of name/phone number pairs. As we work with the
application pair entries will be added, modified and deleted.</p><p>The first thing the program does is call makeWindow, returning a reference to it
which is stored in the variable &quot;win&quot;. Looking at the code in the function
&quot;makeWindow&quot; we can see all the widgets talked about above. The widgets are set
into three frames which are then packed vertically.</p><p>The top frame is a 2x2 grid for the name and phone entry fields and labels to
the left of them. Notice the rather strange form of the call</p><pre class="python-interpreter">
Label(frame1, text=&quot;Name&quot;).grid(row=0, column=0, sticky=W)
</pre><p>Here we create a label and immediately &quot;grid&quot; it into row=0, column=0. We loose
all reference to it but frame1 has it tucked away. This is a very common way
to define widgets when once they are created and set in their parent, we need no
further contact with them.</p><p>Notice that two globals, &quot;nameVar&quot; and &quot;phoneVar&quot; reference StringVar objects that
are tied to the Entry widgets &quot;name&quot; and &quot;phone&quot;.</p><p>The second frame contains the 4 buttons packed left to right. Each is tied
to a callback function which we'll discuss shortly. Here we've assigned each
button to a variable (like &quot;b1&quot;) but since we don't access them later we could have done
the same thing that we did with the label above.</p><pre class="python-interpreter">
Button(frame2,text=&quot; Add  &quot;,command=addEntry).pack(side=LEFT)
</pre><p>Finally the listbox and its scrollbar are packed into their own frame3. The
&quot;fill&quot; parameters guarentee that the scrollbar and listbox will be the same height
and that the listbox (fill=BOTH) will expand to the full width of the parent window.</p><p>The function setSelect first sorts the phonelist (it may get out of sort order during
modifcations to it) and then essentially writes it to the listbox.</p><p>Once the window is built and the listbox initially populated a new function
win.mailoop() is called. This puts the program into the event driven mode where
everything that happens, until the program exits, is due to callback functions,
initiated in this program by clicking the buttons.</p><p>Run the program and click one of the names in the list box. Then click the Load
button. The name and phone number of your selection should appear in the Entry
widgets. Clicking the Load button activated the callback function LoadEntry which
first accessed the index of your listbox selection (via function whichSelected())
and then accessed the data from the list &quot;phonelist&quot;. Now modify the Entry widgets
contents and click Update or Add. Play around also with the Delete function.</p><p>A little careful study should make this program completely understandable. But
it is incomplete is several respects. Most glaringly, there is no way to save
your changes when the window is closed! As an exercise, add a Save button and make
it work. One possiblity is to have Save's callback write a new &quot;phones.py&quot; to
import the next time the program is run. Another is to use the &quot;pickle&quot; module
to store the contents of &quot;phonelist&quot; between runs.</p><p>In the followup to this study, we'll extend this program to use a MySQL database
for storing the phone list. This will enable multiple people to modify the
list concurrently.</p>
