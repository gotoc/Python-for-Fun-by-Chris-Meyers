    <h2 class="first">Purpose of this Collection</h2>
    <p>
    This collection is a presentation of several small Python programs.  They
    are aimed at intermediate programmers; people who have studied Python and
    are fairly comfortable with basic recursion and object oriented techniques.
    Each program is very short, never more than a couple of pages and
    accompanied with a write-up.
    </p>
    <p>
    I have found Python to be an excellent language to express algorithms
    clearly.  Some of the ideas here originated in other programs in other
    languages.  But in most cases I developed code from scratch from just an
    outline of an idea. However <q>Lisp in Python</q> was almost a translation
    exercise from John McCarthy's original <q>Evalquote in Lisp</q>.
    </p>
    <p>
    From many years of programming these are some of my favorite programs. I
    hope you enjoy them as much as I do.  I look forward to hearing from
    readers, especially folks with suggestions for improvements, ideas for new
    projects, or people who are doing similar things.  You can email me at
    <a href="mailme.html">mailme.html</a>
    </p>
    <p>
    Many thanks to Paul Carduner and Jeff Elkner for their work on this page,
    especially for Paul's graphic of <q>Psyltherin</q> (apologies to Harry
    Potter) and to the Twisted developement team for their Lore documentation
    generator to which all the other web pages in this collection have been
    recently adapted.
