Lisp, it is instructive to look at the original Lisp evaluation mechanism. At the heart of
the Lisp language is an recursive interplay between evaluating expressions, which means applying functions
to arguments. But that requires further evaluation of the functions arguments and internal
expressions. The result is an extremely elegant piece of code.</p><p>When I was a student of computer science at the University of Oregon in 1971, I took a
course in Artificial Intelligence. We got exposed to some of the classic Lisp programs
but, unfortunately, had no way of running them. So our projects were written in Fortran and
were not very impressive.</p><p>So when I came across &quot;Lisp in Lisp&quot; taking up most of page 13 of the Lisp 1.5 Users Manual
I had a stronger motivation than just esthetics to do something with it.
I figured that if I could translate just that much Lisp into Fortran, then
I would have the means to run other Lisp programs. It was much easier said than done. Fortran
did not support recursion and this was an example of true &quot;functional programming&quot;.
There was not a single GOTO or variable assignment. Each function call and return had
to done in Fortran with computed GOTO's, first pushing or popping information on stacks
implemented with Fortran arrays. It was very messy. Later I did a version
in PDP-11 Assembler and, still later, one in Pascal which was pretty clean.</p><p>This Lisp implemented in Python is mostly a translation of the original Lisp. If you have
a chance to look at the original Lisp in Lisp, I think you'll agree with me that the Python
code is much easier to get your head around. Like the original
it is very short and, except for input of
S expressions, completely functional. That basically means no variable assignments or
explicit loops. Where we would normally use a &quot;for&quot; or &quot;while&quot; loop, you will see
tail recursion.</p><p>I made a few small changes in this design. Lisp supports both lists and binary trees. In fact
lists in Lisp are simply a special form of tree. Our Python Lisp supports only lists. In addition
I added two small commands that will let us use the program interactively.</p><h2>Introduction to Lisp<a name="auto1"></a></h2><p>The basis for both programs and data in Lisp is the S (symbolic) expression. An S expression may
be a symbol, a number, or a series of S expressions in parentheses. Here are some
examples.</p><pre class="shell">
george
54
(george 54 (sue 48))
</pre><p>As you can see S expressions may be nested.</p><p>Certain forms of S expressions may be evaluated. For example &quot;(+ 5 4)&quot; would apply
the primitive function '+' to the arguments (5 and 4) and return the number 9, which is also an
S expression. All function calls list the function name first, followed by the arguments.
Here are some more examples of S expression evaluation.</p><pre class="shell">
S expression        Evaluation   Comments

234                 234          numbers evaluate to themselves
(quote charlie)     charlie      quote stops further evaluation
(quote (a b c))     (a b c)      quote stops further evaluation
'charlie            charlie      'x is shorthand for (quote x)
t                   t            symbol for &quot;true&quot;
nil                 nil          symbol for &quot;false&quot; same as ()
(eq 5 5)            t            eq returns t or nil
(eq 5 6)            nil
(car '(a b c))      a            car returns 1st item in a list
(cdr '(a b c))      (b c)        cdr returns rest of a list
(cons 'a '(b c))    (a b c)      cons combines args to make a new list
</pre><p>Notice that we used (car '(a b c)) instead of (car (a b c)). The quote is necessary
to keep (a b c) from another layer of evaluation. This will be clearer as we
proceed.</p><p>When eval is called it is passed the S expression and also an association list. The
above evaluations did not need the association list (alist for short) because we
were evaluating either constants or functions whose arguments are constants.</p><p>Here is an example alist.</p><pre class="shell">
((a 2) (b 6) (c (george 45)))
</pre><p>It pairs the variables a to 2, b to 6, and c to (george 45). Here are some more sample
evaluations assuming this alist.</p><pre class="shell">
S expression  Evaluation  Comments

c             (george 45) variables are looked up in the alist
(eq a 2)      t           arguments to a function are evaluated first
(eq a b)      nil
(car c)       george
</pre><p>Finally, there are a few special forms of S expressions. These are not functions even though
the look like function calls. Their arguments are not evaluated before processing. One we've already
seen is <code>quote</code>.
Another is the &quot;conditional&quot; <code>cond</code> which is very much like a <code>case</code> or <code>switch</code>
statement in other languages, or like a Python <code>if</code>, <code>elif</code>, ... <code>else</code>. It takes
the following form.</p><pre class="shell">
(cond  A B ...)
</pre><p>where A, B, etc. are lists of two elements each. The first element of each pair is
evaluated until one is true (not nil). Then the second element of that pair is
evaluated and that value is returned as the value of the cond.
The remaining pairs are not evaluated. Generally the last pair has <code>t</code> for its first
element which makes it work like an <code>else</code>. For example with the <code>alist</code> above</p><pre class="shell">
(cond ((eq a 1) (cdr george)) (t 3))   would return 3
(cond ((eq a 2) (cdr george)) (t 3))   would return (45)
</pre><p>Another special form is used for user defining functions. It is easiest to provide
an example and explain it. The following is a function definition to square a number.</p><pre class="shell">
(lambda (x) (* x x))
</pre><p>The symbol <code>lambda</code> introduces this form. It is followed by an S expression with the
function parameters, and an S expression which is the body of the funciton.
It may be applied to arguments just like any primitive function. Again, assuming we
have the alist above ...</p><pre class="shell">
((lambda (x) (* x x)) a)     evaluates to 4.
</pre><p>In evaluation the argument a is evaluated (yields 2). Then the lambda expression
is applied to 2. The parameter <code>x</code> is paired with 2 on the alist which now looks like</p><pre class="shell">
((x 2) (a 2) (b 6) (c (george 45)))
</pre><p>Finally, (* x x) is evaluated. x is replaced with 2 from the alist and the primitive
function &quot;*&quot; is applied yielding 4.</p><p>I added one special form not in the original code. (def x y) will bind a name x to an
S expression y. The alist is saved in a global variable when these definitions are
made and therefore remain for later evaluations. This form is especially useful to
bind names to functions. For example</p><pre class="shell">
(def square (lambda (x) (* x x)))
(sq 4)
</pre><h2>Representing S expressions in Python.<a name="auto2"></a></h2><p>Python lists are convenient to store S expressions. Nested S expressions can be
handled simply with nested lists. Strings may be used for symbols and numbers can
represent themselves. So our S expression <code>(lambda (x) (* x x))</code> would be
<code>['lambda', ['x'], ['*','x','x']]</code>.</p><h2>Tail Recursion<a name="auto3"></a></h2><p>We should talk about tail recursion a bit. It is used in our Python code although sometimes
we could have used a <code>for</code> or <code>while</code> loop instead. However if you want to create Lisp functions
then you must use tail recursion because we are not providing any other means of iteration!</p><p>Lets look at an example. A call to <code>assoc(x,alist)</code> walks down the name/value pairs in the alist
until it finds a pair whose 1st element matches x. Then it returns the 2nd element (the value).
Here is how to write assoc using a <code>for</code> loop.</p><pre class="python">

If there is no 1st element, raise an error. Or simply search the rest of the alist recursively.
Eventually either the right pair will be found or an error will be raised.</p><h2>Walking through the Code.<a name="auto4"></a></h2><p>At this point you will probably want to bring up the code in a separate window, or just
print it out. It's a couple of pages. The two modules are <a href="lisp.py">lisp.py</a> and <a href="lispio.py">lispio.py</a></p><p>In the module lispio.py we have a function <code>getSexp</code> to input an S expression from the
user and return the equivalent Python list. We also the have a function <code>putSexp</code> to convert
a Python list (representing an S expression) to a string in Lisp.</p><p>The function <code>getSexp</code> uses <code>getToken</code> to extract symbols, numbers and special characters from
the input provided by the user. It also uses itself to extract nested S expressions.
In turn, <code>getToken</code> uses <code>nextChar</code> to see if the next character is part of the token it is
building and <code>getChar</code> to grab it. So at the bottom of the food chain is <code>nextChar</code> which actually
has to deal with getting input from the user.</p><p>Lets play with getToken a bit.</p><pre class="python-interpreter">

</pre><p>Notice that there are 2 versions of the function <code>nextChar</code>. One just uses <code>raw_input</code> which
means the user must type everything in. The other uses the userInput module
letting us put programs in files and running them thru the indirect file mechanism.
For more information on the UserInput module <a href="../userInput/userInput.html">click here</a>.</p><p>The main functions in lisp.py are apply and eval. Each is a set of if/elif/else
statements that handle the various options discussed above. The handling is done
with the Python list operators. The other functions, pairlis, assoc, evcon, and
evlis are just auxillary functions. The names are the same as in the original Lisp code. You will
notice that they are tail recursive.</p><p>The function <code>pairlis</code> adds pairs to the alist (returning an expanded alist)
and <code>assoc</code> finds values for variables in the alist passed.
The function <code>evcon</code> is special for handling cond expressions as described above.
<code>evlis</code> is similar to the Python <code>map</code> function. It evaluates each item in the list passed
and returns a list of the values.</p><p>The lisp main function interacts with the user. As long as the user inputs an
S expression to evaluate, it is passed to eval and the result printed. If lispio.nextchar
is using the userInput module then the S expressions may be loaded from a file. This
is generally used to define functions.</p><p>There are two extra commands handled in eval. <code>def</code> allows us to set variables or define
functions by adding a pair onto the
global Alist. And the special symbol <code>alist</code> is permanently set to the global Alist letting
us view it easily. When the user enters a new S expression to evaluate, we start out with this
preloaded alist.</p><p>Lets use the interactive mode to evaluate some expresssions.
Here we use <code>def</code> to set the variable a to 6 on the alist.</p><pre class="python-interpreter">

Lisp&gt;(def b (lambda () (+ x x)))
b
Lisp&gt;(a 5)
10.0
</pre><p>The function <code>b</code> is able to see the value for <code>x</code> even
though <code>x</code> is not an argument. In fact the function <code>b</code> doesn't
take arguments. But since the value of <code>x</code> is determined by a simple search
of the alist, its setting from the calling function <code>a</code> is found.</p><h2>Some Ideas for Projects.<a name="auto6"></a></h2><p>You can extend this program in many ways. Extra primitives like turning the debug
flag on and off, or providing access to user input would be useful. The system could
also be expanded with functions written in Lisp (like length) that are loaded at input.
A more complete system could be a combination of Python and Lisp.
For the  ambitious, the Python code could be translated back to Lisp and then
you could run Lisp in Lisp in Python. Compare its speed to just Lisp in Python and
then to a regular interpreter like Scheme.</p>
