you need to write effective database programs. By looking at any SQL reference
book, it is obvious that there is vastly more to the subject than what is
presented here. But in several years of programming with SQL and Python I've
found that about 98% of what I do is in the following pages.</p><p>We will be using PostgreSQL and Python together. At work I use Sybase for
the database server but for most readers open source PostgreSQL is much more
affordable and still very powerful. Another open source option that you can
explore is MySQL.</p><h2>Servers and Clients<a name="auto0"></a></h2><p>Relational database systems are client/server systems. In PostgreSQL the
server is called the postmaster and does all the actual interaction with the
data itself. Clients are programs that make requests to the server to either
read or modify the database. This approach allows several clients to
simultaneously access the data with the server doing all the necessary
synchronization.</p><p>There are two types of client we'll look at. One is the program psql that
comes with the PostgreSQL system and lets us examine and modify data easily
interactively, similar to the Python interactive mode. The other type of
client is a Python program you write that imports the <code>pg</code> module to 
do the same kind of interactions that psql does but retrieve the result in
Python data structures.</p><h2>Nature of the data<a name="auto1"></a></h2><p>In thinking about databases it is useful to consider some analogies,
although they should not be taken too literally.</p><p>The server may access many databases but a client will operate on only 
one at a time. Think of a database as a directory in your file system. Tables
in the database are something like files in the directory. Tables consist of
rows and columns and you may think of them as spreadsheets. Each column has a
name and can hold a particular type of data such as an integer, a floating
point number, or a string.  Each relational database system has its own set of
datatypes. PostgreSQL has about 40. But the datatypes you'll use over and over
again are numbers (ints and floats), strings, and dates.</p><p>It is important to realize at the start what columns cannot hold.  You
can't put a Python list or dictionary into a column, as lovely as that would
be. Later we will see how we can join tables together to achieve this kind
of versatility with our data.</p><p>Tables can also have indexes which maintain the data in sorted order and
serve 3 main purposes.
One is to make
accessing data much faster. If the client requests a certain row from a table by 
a data value in one or more or its columns,
the server will not have to read (perhaps) the entire table to find the row in
question if the table is indexed by that set of columns. Instead the row is found
by bouncing around a much smaller (and sorted) index. Secondly, indexes let
us processes a set of rows in the sorted order. Finally, indexes are 
necessary if we want to guarentee that each row has a unique value in a column
(or set of columns). We'll go into indexes in more detail later.</p><h2>Using psql with postmaster<a name="auto2"></a></h2><p>First make sure the server (postmaster) is running. If you are on a multiuser system a
system administrator may be responsible for this and has also created a
database for your use, or perhaps to share with others.</p><p>I'm using Linux on a standalone system so I will start the postmaster
(from the postgres login) in local mode (just my machine) and create a test
database. We'll use a dedicated window to run postmaster.
The &quot;$&quot; is the shell prompt</p><pre class="shell">
$ postmaster -i localhost
</pre><p>Messages from postmaster will appear the in this window.</p><p>Next, logged in another window as user <code>postgres</code>, I'll create a
fresh database called <code>school</code> to play with. Then I'll activate the
psql client attaching it to my database <code>school</code>. We're now ready to 
add and manipulate tables in <code>school</code>. The program <code>psql</code>
issues the prompt <code>school=#</code>, showing which database it has open.
</p><pre class="shell">
$ createdb school
$ psql school
school=#
</pre><h2>Operations on Tables<a name="auto3"></a></h2><p>Tables are created by giving them a name and a set of columns. Each column
in turn needs a name and a datatype. Here is a simple example.</p><pre class="shell">
school=# create table course (number int, name varchar(24), credits int);
</pre><p>Here we have created a simple table with information about courses.  We are
using a column for the course number, another for its name, and one for the number
of credits. The
name is defined as <code>varchar</code> (variable length character string)
which is like a Python string except that this one has a maximum length of 24.
The course number and credits are stored as integers.</p><p>The opposite operation of <code>create table</code> is
<code>drop table</code>. You may think of <code>drop</code> as <code>delete</code> or,
if you are unix fan, <code>rm</code>.</p><pre class="shell">
school=# drop table course;
</pre><p>Once a table is created, clients do mostly four things with them.  Insert a
new row, delete a row, update column values in a new row and finally select
rows (read).</p><h2>Inserting rows into a table<a name="auto4"></a></h2><p>Inserting rows can be done in 2 ways. The simplest is to list the column
values in the same order as the columns were defined when created. For example
</p><pre class="shell">
school=# insert into course values (3, 'Computer Programming', 1);
</pre><p>Another way is to first list the column names followed by values.
</p><pre class="shell">
school=# insert into student (id,name) values (411, 'Bayartsogt, Gombo');
</pre><p>This method is handy if some columns have default values or can take a null
value (think Python None). These columns and their values may be omitted from
the insert statment. You can check your reference book on how to expand the
<code>create table</code> statement to specify defaults with columns.</p><h2>Deleting rows from a table<a name="auto5"></a></h2><p>Deleting rows from a table is as simple as identifying them. For example.</p><pre class="shell">
school=# delete from course where number=120
</pre><p>The clause <code>where number=120</code> specifies a single row, at least
with what we have in the table so far. But if there were two rows in the table
with this number, both would be deleted. In fact, the <code>where</code> clause 
may be omitted in which case all rows in the table are deleted. So
<code>delete from course</code> empties the course table.</p><p>Actually, <code>where</code> clauses are a lot like boolean expressions in
Python, i.e.  what you find after keywords like <code>if</code> and
<code>while</code>. But there are some differences you'll want to remember. In
SQL you use a single <code>=</code> to test for equality instead of
<code>==</code>.  And where you would find variable names in Python SQL requires
column names. But and's and or's are allowed and you're free to use parantheses 
as you would expect. One thing to watch out for in postgreSQL is that you must use
single quotes for strings. Double quotes are used for another purpose.</p><p>One common practice that is quite different is pattern matching with string
data. Exact matching is simply <code>name='Algebra II'</code> but the phrase
<code>name like 'Algebra%'</code> would match any string starting with
<q>Algebra</q>.  The <code>%</code> character is the wildcard character for
SQL's <code>like</code> operator. With Python these kind of matches generally
require the <code>re</code> (regular expression) module.</p><p><code>Where</code> clauses are probably the most complex and powerful part
of SQL. They are used with <code>update</code> and <code>select</code>
statements just as they are with <code>delete</code>. We'll see several
examples as we go along.</p><h2>Updating rows in a table<a name="auto6"></a></h2><p>Updating columns in a table is straighforward. A <code>where</code> clause
identifies the row (or rows) to update. The <code>set</code> clause identifies
the columns and their new values.</p><pre class="shell">
school=# update student set name='George' where id=411;
</pre><p>You can modify a single column, several columns or even all columns
depending on your <code>where</code> clause (or lack of one). You may also
update several columns in a single update statement. Just separate
<code>name=value</code>(s) with commas.</p><h2>Selecting rows from a table<a name="auto7"></a></h2><p>The <code>select</code> statement is the most interesting and the one
you will use most often, probably 90% of the time. Here is a simple example
which select all columns (*) from all rows (no where clause) from the table
course.</p><pre class="shell">
school=# select * from course;
 number |         name         | credits
--------+----------------------+---------
    101 | Algebra I            |       5

    314 | Computer Programming |       4
    204 | Spanish II           |       3
(6 rows)
</pre><p>Adding a <code>where</code> clause lets us control how much we get back
</p><pre class="shell">
school=# select * from course where name like 'Algebra%';
 number |    name    | credits
--------+------------+---------
    101 | Algebra I  |       5
    201 | Algebra II |       5
(2 rows)
</pre><p>The <code>*</code> above indicates all columns. If only some are wanted you
specify them by name.</p><pre class="shell">
school=# select number,credits from course where credits &gt; 4;
 number | credits
--------+---------
    101 |       5
    201 |       5
    301 |       5
(3 rows)
</pre><h2>Beyond the basics<a name="auto8"></a></h2><p>Now that you've seen the four basic operations on tables it's time to extract
from multiple tables.
Relational databases are so named because tables are related to each
other by common values. To illustrate this we need to create a couple more
tables; one for students and one for teachers. To make this easier we put the necessary
sql into two files, <a href="teachers.sql">teachers.sql</a> and
<a href="students.sql">students.sql</a>. Take a look at these. They're pretty
bare-boned with each student and teacher having simply a name and an id number.
Id numbers are necessary to distinguish duplicate names. In practice the id
numbers for people are often social security numbers. Id numbers are also great
for joining tables together as we'll see.</p><p>We can load these files with psql redirecting stdin to the files. The contents
of the files simply replace what you would type.</p><pre class="shell">
$ psql school &lt; teachers.sql
$ psql school &lt; students.sql
$ psql school   
school=# select * from teacher;
  id  |     name
------+---------------
 1001 | Elkner, Jeff
 1002 | Meyers, Chris
 1003 | Downey, Allen
(3 rows)
   
school=# select * from student;
 id  |   name
-----+-----------
 411 | Bayartsogt, Gombo
 412 | McMahon, John
 413 | Kern, Owen
 414 | Cohen, Jonah
(4 rows)
</pre><p>Let's talk about relationships between rows in different tables. They fall into 3
catagories; one to one, one to many, and many to many.</p><p>An example of a one-to-one relationship might be a parking space assigned
to a teacher. One parking space; one teacher. The easiest way to make this
relationship in our database is to make the parking space number a column in
the teacher table. If, perhaps, more information about parking spaces were
required, we could have a separate table for parking spaces.  The parking space 
number in both tables would tie the teacher to the extra information in the
parking table.
</p><p>An example of a one-to-many relationship might be teachers to courses.
We'll assume each course is taught by a single teacher but that each teacher
may teach several courses. In a Python program we might have a object class of
teacher with an attribute of courses, a list containing the course numbers.
But remember that we can't store lists in a database. What we do instead is
have a column in the course table that contains a single teacher id. We'll see in a
bit how this solves the problem.</p><p>Finally an example of a many-to-many relationship might be students and
courses. Each course has many students and students take many courses.
Representing this kind of relationship requires an extra table that ties students
and courses together. We'll call this table &quot;enrolled&quot; and it will have a
row for each combination of student and course.</p><pre class="shell">
school=# create table enrolled (studentId int, courseId int);
</pre><p>If we have 3 students each taking 4 courses, our table would have 12 rows
(3*4).</p><h2>Working with multiple tables<a name="auto9"></a></h2><p>Let's drop the tables and reload them from these files;
<a href="teachers.sql">teachers.sql</a>, <a href="courses.sql">courses.sql</a>,
<a href="students.sql">students.sql</a> and
<a href="enrolled.sql">enrolled.sql</a>.</p><pre class="shell">
$ psql school &lt; teachers.sql
$ psql school &lt; students.sql
$ psql school &lt; courses.sql
$ psql school &lt; enrolled.sql
</pre><p>Now things get a little more interesting. We can use the relations between
the tables to make more complex queries.</p><p>Let's list all courses taught by teacher 1001</p><pre class="shell">
$ psql school
school=# select name,teacherId from course where teacherId=1001;
         name         | teacherid
----------------------+-----------
 World History        |      1001
 Computer Programming |      1001
(2 rows)
</pre><p>But suppose we want to list the  teacher's name instead of their id.  To do
this we need to <code>join</code> the course and teacher tables. Our first
attempt will be</p><pre class="shell">
school=# select course.name, teacher.name from course,teacher;
</pre><p>Because both tables have a column called <code>name</code> the columns need
to be qualified by their table names; thus, course.name and teacher.name.
There is still a problem, however. If you try the above query you'll get 18
rows; 3 teachers times 6 courses. That's what happens when tables are joined.
To trim our answers to what we want we need to add a simple
<code>where</code> clause.</p><pre class="shell">
school=# select course.name, teacher.name from course,teacher
school-#   where teacher.id=teacherId;
         name         |     name

</pre><p>There was no need to qualify the column name <code>teacherId</code> since
it is unambiguous</p><p>We can also sort the output with an <code>order</code> clause.
<code>Order</code> clauses always come after <code>where</code> clauses. For
example</p><pre class="shell">
school=# select course.name, teacher.name from course,teacher
school-#   where teacher.id=teacherId
school-#   order by course.name;

order first by course name and then by student name.</p><pre class="shell">

school-#  where course.number=enrolled.courseNumber

</pre><h2>The Python connection<a name="auto10"></a></h2><p>Importing the module <code>pg</code> into a Python program gives us the same 
access to the postmaster server that we have with psql.</p><p>Let's play with the pg module in the interactive mode.  The first thing we
must do in our program is to establish a connection to a database. Here is an
example. (<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> is Python's prompt)</p><pre class="python-interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; import pg
&gt;&gt;&gt; conn = pg.connect(dbname=&quot;school&quot;, host=&quot;localhost&quot;, user=&quot;postgres&quot;)
</pre><p>Remember that the postmaster server is running on our local machine with
the <code>-i localhost</code> switch. If your situation is different then you
would specify the actual computer in the <code>host</code> parameter.</p><p>With a database connection we can perform querys just like with psql.  Let's 
do one.</p><pre class="python-interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; result = conn.query(&quot;select * from course&quot;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print result
number|name                |credits|teacherid
------+--------------------+-------+---------
   101|Algebra I           |      5|     1003
   201|Algebra II          |      5|     1002
   150|World History       |      2|     1001

   204|Spanish II          |      3|     1003
(6 rows)
</pre><p>Now, this is nice but we will want to manipulate the results of the query, not
just print them in this somewhat hokey table format. Happily,
<code>result</code> is an object with attributes and methods that let us access 
the data as Python values. In fact its <code>__str__</code> method produces the
output above. One of the most useful methods is
<code>dictresult</code> which returns a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary
represents a row.</p><pre class="python-interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; print result.dictresult()
[{'number': 101, 'name': 'Algebra I', 'credits': 5, 'teacherid': 1003},
{'number': 201, 'name': 'Algebra II', 'credits': 5, 'teacherid': 1002},
{'number': 150, 'name': 'World History', 'credits': 2, 'teacherid': 1001},

{'number': 204, 'name': 'Spanish II', 'credits': 3, 'teacherid': 1003}]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre><p>I massaged the line endings a bit to make it more clear. Each
key/value pair in each dictionary represents a column name and value. In the
small programs to come we'll use this method for making a report.</p><p>Now lets consider joining two tables.</p><pre class="python-interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; cmd = &quot;&quot;&quot;select course.name,teacher.name from course,teacher
...           where teacher.id=course.teacherId order by course.name&quot;&quot;&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; result = conn.query(cmd)

{'name': 'Downey, Allen'}, {'name': 'Elkner, Jeff'}]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre><p>Oops! Notice that our dictionaries only have the teacher names and not the
course names. This is because both tables use the same column name
<code>name</code>. To get around this we need to apply an alias to one of the
column names. In this case we choose to give teacher.name the alias
<code>tname</code>.</p><pre class="python-interpreter">

{'name': 'Spanish II', 'tname': 'Downey, Allen'},
{'name': 'World History', 'tname': 'Elkner, Jeff'}]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre><p>There is another way besides dictresult() to get at the data.  Two methods
are used; one returns a tuple of the field names and the other a list of tuples 
with the column values.</p><pre class="python-interpreter">

</pre><p>This method probably runs somewhat faster, but programs using dictionaries
are more readable (IMHO) since the column names appear in the expressions.</p><h2>A little report program<a name="auto11"></a></h2><p>Now we are going to write two versions of a tiny report program that lists
teachers alphabetically and under each one another alphabetical list of the
courses they teach. These programs will demonstrate two different ways to
accomplish the same goal. A bit later we'll discuss when one method might be more
efficient than the other.</p><pre class="python">

is virtually no difference. However if we had 500 teachers the first method
would require 501 querys; the second still only one. The second is apt to
perform much faster. However, if queries get too complex, generally by joining
too many large tables together, the time required for the server to process them can
unexpectably explode. The reasons for this are not terribly clear. But the
solution is to use the first method or a combination of the two where you
balance minimizing the number of queries and their complexity. It sometimes
takes some experimentation to find the best answer in each situation.</p><p>The query method will actually take any SQL statement. So you can use it
to update and delete rows as well as insert rows. When used for these purposes
no result object is returned.</p><pre class="shell">
&gt;&gt;&gt; db.query(&quot;update teacher set name='Gardner, Martin' where id=401&quot;)
</pre><h2>Using tables with indexes<a name="auto12"></a></h2><p>Indexes make searching for rows in a table very fast. You, the user, simply
tell the server to create an index for a given column (or combination of
columns) and the server takes care of updating the index as new rows are
inserted, deleted, or updated. You never have to tell the server to use an
index. It figures that out from your query.</p><p>To create an index you can issue a simple command from psql. It is uncommon
to create indexes from Python since it is generally a one-time activity.</p><pre class="shell">
school=# create index inxTeacherName on teacher (name);
</pre><p>Indexes are given a name (here inxTeacherName), a table to index and one or
more columns to build the index from.  To remove an index you drop it.</p><pre class="shell">
school=# drop index inxTeacherName;
</pre><p>By using the keyword <code>unique</code> the server will prohibit the
insertion of a row where the index key is already present. The following pair
of indexes on the enrolled table make searching both ways (students by course,
or courses by student) very fast and also guarentee that no student is enrolled 
in the same course twice.</p><pre class="shell">
school=# create unique index inxEnrolled1 on enrolled (studentId,courseNum);
school=# create unique index inxEnrolled2 on enrolled (courseNum,studentId);
</pre><p>One caveat with using indexes. They can get fragmented with lots of
insertions, in a manner similiar to disk fragmentation when you add lots of new 
files. The solution for this is to periodically drop and re-create the index.
You'll know when it's time when searches start getting slower and slower.</p>
