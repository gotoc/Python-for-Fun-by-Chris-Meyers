user input.</p><p>Input from the user may be done in a couple of ways in Python.  The function 
<code>raw_input</code> may be used to input a string and <code>input</code> is
commonly used for numbers. Actually any Python expression may be input.</p><p>In this study we will take a somewhat different approach. First some
background.</p><p>Digital Equipment Corp. (DEC) has had a successful family of mini computers
that began with the PDP-11 in the 1970's, extended to the VAX series in the
80's and 90's, and today is represented by the DEC ALPHA. Several of the
operating systems on these machines have an interesting feature called indirect 
files.</p><p>Using the correct call to the OS, the system prompts the user for input. If
the user inputs a response, it is returned. If the user inputs the end of file
character (Cntl-Z on these systems) it is a signal that the program should
exit. But if the user responds with <q>@</q> followed by a filename, it
indicates that the program should open this (indirect) file and read a line
which becomes the users response. Further calls for input read successive lines
from the file until there are no more. Then the user is prompted again to
input from the console. This general and fairly simple mechanism made it
possible for almost all programs to be easily scripted.</p><p>While input is taken from the indirect file nothing is printed on the user
terminal.  In addition, the indirect file may also contain a reference to
another indirect file. This nesting may be arbitrarily deep.</p><p>We will build a little set of classes to emulate this behavior plus a
couple of additional features. Click <a href="userInput_py.html">here</a> to
see the full Python source.</p><p>The class InputString provides a method <code>get</code> that to get input
from the user of indirect file. The filStack list contains a stack of open file 
instances of indirect files are currently active. If none are open, filStack is 
an empty list.  The method <code>get</code> uses a while loop to read lines
from either the user or the current indirect file until it has a valid line to
return, or the user has input the end of file character.</p><p>There are two additional features to our class. When the InputString object
is created the option <code>Echo=1</code> may be included to force prompts and
responses to be printed whether coming from the user or indirect files. The
default <code>Echo=0</code> inhibits this for indirect files. The second
feature allows comments to included which are skipped over, that is, not passed 
back to the program. A comment is any line begining with the <code>#</code>
character.</p><p>Here is a snippet of code showing how the class is used</p><pre class="python">

to all class instances as <code>self.filStack</code>. This means that
subclasses of InputString will all read from the same set of files. There is
only one user.</p><p>Next we subclass InputString and make InputWord. Each call to its
<code>get</code> method will return the next word from either direct or
indirect input. It uses InputString.get to retrieve a line, splits it into a
list of words, and returns the next word each time it is called.</p><p>Finally we subclass InputWord to make InputNumber. This is fairly simple
since words are simply replaced by numbers in the input. We use the
<code>string.atoi</code> function to convert them. The empty string is checked
for (end of file from user) and passed through.  Otherwise the word returned is 
converted to a integer and returned.</p><p>As an example we'll build a spell checker in python using a set of files
containing correctly spelled words to fill a dictionary. These files may be
retrieved from <a href="spell.tar.gz">spell.tar.gz</a>. Here is a bit of
<code>dict.w</code></p><pre>
